# Simple Neural Network

*This text is inspired by chapters 1 & 2 of Michael Nielsens free online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html). I recommend checking it out if you want more detailed descriptions.*

This document should help explain the basic concepts of how a neural network works and give you a better understanding how the [implementation](src/simple_network/simple_network.py) works.

**Topics we will cover**

- Neural Network description
- Notation
- Some Math
- Backpropagation

## Neural Networks description

Okay, so you probably already know that you can fit a line to some points using linear regression.
