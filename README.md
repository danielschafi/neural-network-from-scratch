# Neural Network from Scratch
This repository contains some Machine Learning / Deep Learning Algorithms implemented from scratch. 
The purpose of the implementations is to be easy to understand and are *not* optimized for performance.

## Dependencies
You can install the necessary dependencies with `uv` & `pip`:
```
uv install
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Main Dependencies
```
numpy
tensorflow # for test datasets
```
